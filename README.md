# Spam_classification
This project implements a spam classifier using three different machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. The classifiers are trained on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contains labeled data for spam and non-spam messages.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of labeled email messages categorized as spam or non-spam. It contains features extracted from the text of the emails, which are utilized by the classifiers for training and evaluation.
# Models
Three different classification models are implemented for the spam classifier:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
Naive Bayes
# Usage
o use this spam classifier, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, etc.).
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.
Run the main script to train and evaluate the models.
